Here we expect to cover a mix of some technical metrics of the system as well as the \textit{case study} on Dybbølsbro. 
For the former, we expect cover the precision of OpenDataCam (including YOLO4) with stats such as

\begin{itemize}
	\item Share of bicycles detected (\%)
	\item Mean and median trajectory length
	\item For all frames a bike is visible (and detected at least once), what share of them was the bike detected.
\end{itemize}

which are all compared to "ground truth" dataset that we annotate manually. We know from previoues works with OpenDataCam
that vehecle detection has achieved 95\% accuracy, while performing worse for pedestrians and motorcycles (\cite{BROEKMAN2021100068}).

On the Dybbølsbro study we will focus on how well it reproduces the real-world trajectories (desire lines) that
we observe. While the desire line analysis report of Dybbølsbro (from Copenhagenize) is gone, it's from 2014 and a lot of changes have happened since.
We may apply the system to an intersection at Holmens Kanal, as a report is availeble. Although from 2015, it's a good benchmark to compare against.
