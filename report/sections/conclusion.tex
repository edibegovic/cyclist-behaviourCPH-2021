Our method compares favorably to manual annotation and achieves the objective of capturing mobility
from a \textit{river} or 'birds-eye view'. This allows the abstraction of desire lines through aggregated cyclist movement. 
The \textit{ballet} or micro-perspective is achieved with the easy reference and 
inferring of cyclist mindset using the "Red zones" feature of our interface.

However, in the future, this methodology could be improved further with more advanced technique in 
multiple object tracking and clustering techniques.
